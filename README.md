# react-portfolio

## Description

A bit over two months ago I created my first portfolio app using basic HTML and CSS. While I was proud of what I created, I knew that if I were to stick with learning that I could build a way better portfolio project. And here it is. Its fun to see how far I have come in such a short time.

This iteration of my portfolio utilizes React (the name probably gave that away already) instead of basic HTML and CSS. This app contains six of the projects that I have worked on over the last couple months while in boot camp.
